The Turtle library:              The Turtle library is a fun and engaging library.          It allows users to control a virtual “turtle” that           moves around the screen, drawing shapes and           patterns as it goes. With simplecommands,           students can create everything from basic           geometric shapes to intricate designs,           making coding both a creative and interactive           experience.                                                                                                                                        2","How to Use:             First we have to import the module into our script file.
