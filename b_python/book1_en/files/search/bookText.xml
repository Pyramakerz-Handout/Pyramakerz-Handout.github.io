         The Turtle library:




         The Turtle library is a fun and engaging library.
         It allows users to control a virtual “turtle” that

         moves around the screen, drawing shapes and

         patterns as it goes. With simplecommands,

         students can create everything from basic

         geometric shapes to intricate designs,

         making coding both a creative and interactive

         experience.

         First we have to import the module into our script file.










         Then we define a turtle on our window.

                •  my_turtle.forward(100)

                      •  Moves turtle forward by 100

                         units.
                •  my_turtle.left(90)

                      •  Rotates turtle to the left by

                         90 degrees.

                •  my_turtle.right(90)

                      •  Rotates turtle to the right by

                         90 degrees.

              results in a square shape.




           •  We can also use loops:

































         Activity: How about a more challenging shape?















           •  Here we have 8 squares
              each of its own color.

                                           Loop on the colors and draw a
                                            square then rotate 45 degrees











         Activity: What about Hexagonals.












           •  This  time we have 8

              hexagonals each of its

              own color.























                                                                                                          8]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[Solution:

         Notice we only changed 2 numbers in the whole script and we

         have a totally another shape!










         Circles:


           •  You can also draw circles.

         Running the code, you will see the turtle bgine rotating in

         circles 10 times with each circle bigger than the previous.
