Today, you’ll focus on           understanding coordinates, 2D          arrays, and basic Turtle commands           to draw the face of iron man.

This  structure           allows you to store data in a grid-like format, similar to a table           or spreadsheet, with rows and columns.                Take this code for example:                                            for the first print statement (my_list[0][0]) we select the first           list in “my_list” and from this selected list we choose the first           element, which prints “turtle”.                                                                                                                                4","•  We refer to coordinates using (x, y)          •  The middle point is (0, 0):                                                          x = 0                                                          y = 0           •  Going (right / left) will (increase / decrease) the value of x           •  Going (up / down) will (increase / decrease) the value of y                                               Here is our code so far:                                        5","Penup \& Pendown:          We have 3 parts of the face, each with its own starting point.                                                Add this to our code:                       Now build  a  function which we will  use  to  iterate over  the           coordinate points we downloaded.                                                                                                                              6","Imagine you’re drawing a face. You do the following:               •  Pick your pen away from the paper.             •  Go to the Starting point of the drawing.             •  Put your pen on the paper to draw.                           •  Same here, pen up picks up the pen from the canvas, so when                you use goto() it doesn’t draw to the new point, but only               goes to that point without drawing.             •  Set the color of the pen to yellow.            2D Array Looping:             •  len(): Gets the length of a list.             •  range(): makes a list counting from 0 to that number.            •  range(5): Gives us:                •  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]             •  We loop over 2D arrays using index.
