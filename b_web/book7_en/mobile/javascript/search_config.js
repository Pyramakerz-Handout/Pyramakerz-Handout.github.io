You will delve into the structure of web              pages by exploring semantic and non-semantic elements,              and  master  the  art  of  layout  through  padding,  margin,               and display properties. In addition, you will create two              complete HTML and CSS projects, applying their newfound              knowledge to build functional and visually appealing web              pages.

We have to open the code (render it) on a browser to know its use.                       .  1 Semantic Elements: Clearly defines its content.              Used to guide developers to the content of              web  pages  without  the  need  to  render  it.             2 .  They make code easier to debug.                        3","Web          DEVELOPMENT                <table>: defines that the content is a table.            <header>: t defines a header for a web page.            <nav>: It defines a container for navigation links.             <section>: This defines a section in a web page.            <article>:  This  element  contains  the  main  part,          containing  information  about  the  web  page.            <aside>: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar          in a document.            <footer>: It defines a footer for a document or a section.                   Padding \& Margins:             Then use these visualizations to define the types of spacings.            Paddings: define the spacings inside the content.          Margins: define the spacings outside the content.
