Let’s start by creating a new world with a castle theme.                                                                    2","Custom Costume:             •  Search the toolbox for a “wizard custome”.             •  Place the wizard me knight.                                                    •  Rename it to                “StarterCharater”.             •  Move it to                “StarterPlayer”                folder.                                                                                                                                       3","The Wande:             •  Create the Wand: Add a stick object and this will be our               wand.                                                                 •  Add a local script to the stick.                                      4","•  Line 1: get the script parent which is the stick wand.             •  Line 3: Access the ReplicatedStorage.                       •  Line 4: Get the BoomEvent to be used.            •  Line 6: When Tool Equipped, connect it to a function.                       •  Line 8: If mouse button1 was clicked.             •  Line 9: Fire the remote event with the position of the click                as a parameter.                                                                                                                                                     5","•  Line 1: The script retrieves the ReplicatedStorage service,                which is a shared storage used for storing objects that need                to be accessible by both the client and the server.            •  Line 2: The script gets the BoomEvent, a RemoteEvent                stored in ReplicatedStorage. The WaitForChild method is                used to ensure that the event is loaded before trying to                reference it.                     •  Line 4: A local function named boom is defined. It takes                two arguments:                player: The player who triggered the event.                position: The position where the explosion will occur.             •  Line 5: The script creates a new instance of an Explosion.                                                 6","•  Line 6: The script sets the Parent of the explosion to                Workspace, meaning the explosion will appear in the                game world.             •  Line 7: The script sets the Position of the explosion to the               position provided when the event was triggered.             •  Line 10: This line connects the boom function to the                OnServerEvent event of the remoteEvent. This means                that whenever the BoomEvent is triggered by a client, the                boom function will be called, creating an explosion at the                specified location.                    •  Server Events (also known as Remote Events) are a type                of object used for communication between the client (the                player’s device) and the server (the game server).
