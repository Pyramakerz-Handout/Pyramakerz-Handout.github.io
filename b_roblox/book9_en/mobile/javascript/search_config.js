A Rig (demo character) is built for this purpose:                •  From the “AVATAR” tab             •  select “rig builder”            •  choose “my avatar”                                                                     2","This shows a rig player on the map.                  •  Now, open the animation editor (can be found in the                avatar tab too).             •  Animation Editor: is a timeline editor to animate your                character.                           •  Click on the rig you placed on the map.             •  Give your animation a name \& click “Create”                                                                                                                                   3","The interface has 2 main concepts:               •  Animation time: Time of the animation key frames.             •  Timeline: Place of each key frame throughout the                timeline.               Key Frame: is like a checkpoint for a part which saves the           state of the part like its position and rotation.              The 0:00 in timeline has the initial state of the part.           Therefore, any new positions should not start from 0:00 but           later.                                                          4","Animate the Character:          Let’s make a wave animation for the player so it says hello.                •  Notice we can select mini-parts of our character.             •  Select its middle body and rotate it a bit (use the blue                circle in rotation). Note: Press ALT to disable snapping.             •  Try previewing the animation through the play button in               the animation editor.                             •  Imagine a human who waves, we can visualize his hand as                3 points at different places. We can use this for our rig.             •  Rotate the corresponding parts to match this human                model.                                                                                                                                             5","Notice when editing a new part of the body, a key frame is          made in the animation editor.                                  •  You finished the animation. Do you feel its too fast and                needs to be slowed down?             •  You can move key frames in the timeline.            •  You can also duplicate keyframes using CTRL+C \&                CTRL+V                                                      6","Time to export the animation to Roblox, so we can use it any-          where in our game.                                           Give it a name and click save.                                                                                                                                                       7","Copy the animation ID we will use it later.                                                       We want to trigger the animation. While in-game you can           press letter “H” to make this character play the animation.                •  Create a “Local Script” under “StarterPlayer” ->               “StarterPlayerScripts”.             •  We want to press H then the play waves hello.             •  The following code helps us to do so.                           8","•  In line 11, change the animation id (number in the last of                the line) with your animation id you copied.                   •  Code obtains the character in-game when it joins the                world             •  Then, loads the animation inside the script (doesn’t play               it).             •  We create a function to listen for keystrokes and if its the                letter “H” it plays the animation.             •  Finally, we connect the UserInputService with our                function.
