         The animation editor is a tool that helps us make custom

         animation for characters. Let’s make a demo character (Rig).


         A Rig (demo character) is built for this purpose:




           •  From the “AVATAR” tab

           •  select “rig builder”
           •  choose “my avatar”

           •  Now, open the animation editor (can be found in the

              avatar tab too).

           •  Animation Editor: is a timeline editor to animate your

              character.















           •  Click on the rig you placed on the map.

           •  Give your animation a name & click “Create”






















                                                                                                            3]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[The interface has 2 main concepts:



           •  Animation time: Time of the animation key frames.

           •  Timeline: Place of each key frame throughout the

              timeline.





         Key Frame: is like a checkpoint for a part which saves the

         state of the part like its position and rotation.




         The 0:00 in timeline has the initial state of the part.

         Therefore, any new positions should not start from 0:00 but

         later.

         Let’s make a wave animation for the player so it says hello.




           •  Notice we can select mini-parts of our character.

           •  Select its middle body and rotate it a bit (use the blue

              circle in rotation). Note: Press ALT to disable snapping.

           •  Try previewing the animation through the play button in
              the animation editor.

















           •  Imagine a human who waves, we can visualize his hand as

              3 points at different places. We can use this for our rig.

           •  Rotate the corresponding parts to match this human

              model.
































                                                                                                            5]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Notice when editing a new part of the body, a key frame is
         made in the animation editor.






















           •  You finished the animation. Do you feel its too fast and

              needs to be slowed down?

           •  You can move key frames in the timeline.
           •  You can also duplicate keyframes using CTRL+C &

              CTRL+V

         where in our game.

































         Give it a name and click save.

         We want to trigger the animation. While in-game you can

         press letter “H” to make this character play the animation.




           •  Create a “Local Script” under “StarterPlayer” ->
              “StarterPlayerScripts”.

           •  We want to press H then the play waves hello.

           •  The following code helps us to do so.















           8]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[•  In line 11, change the animation id (number in the last of

              the line) with your animation id you copied.







           •  Code obtains the character in-game when it joins the

              world

           •  Then, loads the animation inside the script (doesn’t play
              it).

           •  We create a function to listen for keystrokes and if its the

              letter “H” it plays the animation.

           •  Finally, we connect the UserInputService with our

              function.




           Code can be downloaded from here.

           •  From the toolbox -> search for a “house” -> place the

              house on the map.

           •  place a cylinder which will act as a button to set the house

              on fire.

           •  Add a script to the cylinder



















         Set House on Fire:

         In the script you created add the following:






































           10]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[•  Code obtains the button and checks if it’s touched by the
              player.

           •  Then it loops on the house parts setting each part on fire.

           •  The fire is set by creating a new instance of it and

              appending it to the house.

           •  Code obtains the button and checks if it’s touched by the
              player.

           •  Then it loops on the house parts.

           •  For each part, we append the explosion animation and

              remove the anchored property from it, dismantling it from

              the house.
