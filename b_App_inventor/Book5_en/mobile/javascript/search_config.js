We’ll dive  into  the  exciting  world of                      extensions, expanding your app-building                      possibilities  beyond  imagination.                   Extensions:            They are ready/pre-made parts that provide methods and            blocks to help build features faster.              Application 01: Flashlight App               Our goal is to build an application that toggles your phone            flashlight on and off. Let’s get started!               •  Download the extension on your computer.            •  Create a new project.            •  Import the extension.              •  In the palette column, go to extensions section and click                  Import extension.                                                                                                                                2","•  Click on Browse and select the extension you downloaded,              then click on Import.                                     Now the extension is available in your project, drag and add           it to the components.            To toggle the flashlight on or off, we need clickable buttons           to be present in the UI.              •  Place the following components.             •  2 buttons.             •  TaiFun Flashlight extension.                                 3","•  Go to the blocks editor and add the following blocks.                 Actions are triggered when buttons are clicked. Therefore,              we use the “when button.click” block to set the behavior of              the click. Add one for Button1 and the other for Button2.                                                                                                                                                                                 4","Now we use the extension call blocks to turn the           flashlight on or off. Place each of the On and Off           blocks inside the “when button.click” blocks.                                                  •  Connect the blocks to the final shape.                                             5","To Summarize, you set the behavior of each button using                 ‘when button.click’ to turn the flashlight On or Off using                 ‘call flashlight.on/off’ blocks.                    Congratulations, you’ve built your application. Use AI                 Companion to install \& test the app.                                  Application 02: Alarm App                    Second exercise is to build an app that sets an alarm with                 a custom message of your own. When the time comes,                 the alarm rings displaying the message you wrote.                    Let’s get started!                    •  Download the extension on your computer.                 •  Create a new project.                 •  Import the extension.                                                                                                                            6","•  In the palette column, go to extensions                 section and click Import extension.                          •  Click on Browse and select the extension you downloaded,                 then click on Import.                                                      To program the alarm we need to take some inputs:                •  The hours value to set the alarm.                •  The minutes value to set the alarm.                •  The message to display when the alarm goes off.                Inputs can be obtained through textboxes.                   7","Only thing left is to notify the user when he/she enters an                 empty value and tries to set the alarm. Therefore, a notifier                 is required and we’ll have to program it in the block editor.                    Place the following components:                    •  3 Textboxes.                •  1 notifier.                  •  1 button.                •  TaiFun Alarm.                                                         Go to the blocks editor and place the following blocks.                                                                                                                        8","First, we need to check for when the button is clicked.               Again, we’ll use the “when button.click” block.                                                        Next, we need to check if either of the timer textboxes are               empty. The “if .. then .. else if .. then .. else” block perfectly               suits our needs. It can let us check 2 conditions, in our case               are the hours and minutes textbox fields. Else, we can set               the alarm.                              9","To check if the textbox is empty, we can use the ‘is empty’            block from the text category.                                                        Then we provide the textbox value to the ‘is empty’            block.                                                                                                              10","Then we provide the textbox value to the ‘is empty’ block.                                                  In case the fields are empty, we show an alert to the user,            notifying that the fields are empty.                                            11","From the text block we can set what text to be alerted to                the user.                                                                This should be your result by now.                                                                                                                                        12","We’re not done yet. Now that we have validated the timer             fields, we have to set the alarm. Use the call block from             the alarm extension to set it.                                                               Same it needs some parameters, we’ll use the same                textbox values which we can obtain from the ‘textbox.                  text’ blocks.                           13","Same it needs some parameters, we’ll use the same                  textbox values which we can obtain from the ‘textbox.                  text’ blocks.                                                          •  Arrange the blocks to the following final result.                                                                                                                                            14","Great Work! Let’s summarize what we’ve built.               The application triggers when the button is clicked. We have            2 conditions to test on:            •  If the hours textbox field is empty.            •  If the minutes textbox field is empty.              If neither is empty then we can set the alarm. We use the IF            .. then .. ELSE IF .. then .. ELSE for this purpose.               For each case (IF and ELSE IF) of the empty cases we use            the notifier alert block to display a message to the user no-            tifying him of the error. Else we can set the alarm. We use            the alarm “set” block to set the alarm, providing it with the            required parameters from the textboxes.               When the time comes, the alarm will go off displaying the            message  from the  message  textbox.               •  Now build the app from the build menu, and wait for it to                finish.                                  15","•  Scan the qr code on your phone and open the link to down-                       load the apk.                                                                    •  Install the application                   •  Now test it                      Congratulations, you’ve now learned the usage of extensions                    and how it can help us build apps faster and with more features!                                                                                                                      16","let’s play                                 Enjoy the Ninja Breakout game.
