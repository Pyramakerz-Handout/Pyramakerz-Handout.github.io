Level up your mobile app building skills!                      Today, we’ll dive into adding images and                      sounds to your App Inventor apps for an                      extra dose of fun.              To create a new project named “Proj 2” in MIT App Inventor, follow         the provided link.

(If you’r            having trouble, see the previous lecture first.)              Challenge:           1. Change Screen Title to “Animal App”.           2. Add 3 buttons to the screen to get a result like this:                                                                                            By default, elements  appear  at the  top                                                 left, but you can use screen alignment to                                                 move them anywhere on the screen.                            3","Screen Format: (Alignment):                 Now we can  change  the  screen  format through  screen                properties. There you will find settings for formatting items                horizontally and vertically.                                         C (Horizontal alignment):          While  elements  usually  appear  left          aligned by default, you can use horizontal          alignment to control their position. This lets          you center elements for a balanced look or          position them to the right for          specific layouts.                                                                                                                             4","Vertical Alignment:               By default, elements appear at the top of the screen.                 Use vertical alignment to:            •  Center elements for a balanced layout.            •  Position them at the bottom for specific designs.                                                                 5","Question to ponder:                                                    How many possible formats can be set?
