Have  you  ever  heard  of  something  called                                      \"artificial intelligence\"?                                        Well,  imagine  this:  you're  actually  using  it  all  the                                       time.  Remember  when  your  phone  suddenly                                       unlocked  because  it  recognized  your  face?  That's                                      AI recognizing you!                       2","And  what  about  TikTok?  It  shows  you  videos  you              love,  all  thanks  to  artificial  intelligence  that             understands your preferences.                Siri  and  Google  Assistant  are  your  super  smart              friends who know what you need before you even              ask for it!              Oh, and did you know that some cars can drive on              their own? Yes, this AI is driving it!               The  coolest  part  is  that  these  things  can  think  and  make  decisions  on          their own, without us having to tell them what to do. That's the magic of           artificial intelligence!                                                  Definition of Artificial Intelligence                                           Artificial  intelligence  is  like  giving  computers                                          superhuman abilities!                                         It helps them to think and learn just like we do. With                                         artificial intelligence, computers can look at a set of                                          information,  such  as  images  or  numbers,  and                                         discover  patterns  all  on  their  own.  Then,  they  use                                          what they learn to make decisions, just like we do                                         every  day.  Artificial  intelligence  is  the  computer's                                         ability  to  think  and  learn  so  it  can  perform  tasks                                          typically       done        by     humans.          With       artificial                                         intelligence.                                                                                                                   3","But how does artificial intelligence work?                                          \"Well,  it's  like  teaching  the  computer  how  to  learn  from                                         examples. Imagine we're the teachers, and the computer is                                         our student.                                                First,  we  provide  lots  and  lots  of  examples  to  the                                              computer  about  things  we  want  it  to  learn.  These                                              examples  could  be  pictures  of  animals,  numbers,  or                                              even words.                                              Then,  we  teach  the  computer  how  to  analyze  these                                              examples and find patterns in them. For example, we                                              might  show  it  lots  of  pictures  of  cats  and  dogs  and                                              teach  it  to  look  for  the  things  that  distinguish  a  cat                                              from a dog.\"            The more examples the computer sees, the better it becomes at            recognizing  these  patterns  and  making  smart  guesses  or           decisions. It's like the computer gets smarter and smarter with           each new example it sees!           And that's how artificial intelligence works – computers learn           from  examples  and  make  intelligent  decisions  on  their  own.           Isn't that amazing?                      Live Examples of Artificial Intelligence            1.

Let's  define                               them together:                                           1. Machine Learning:                                        Machine  learning  helps  computers  learn  from                                       examples  and  improve  their  performance  on  tasks.                                        For example, when you play a game and the computer                                       learns your moves to become smarter each time!                2.ChatBots:              Chatbots are chat robots like friendly robots that chat               with us and assist us.
